# AWS AI & ML Scholarship Program - Bike Sharing Demand

## Overview
This project is part of the AWS AI & ML Scholarship Program and is based on the Kaggle competition Bike Sharing Demand.

## Description
Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people can rent a bike from one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. This competition requires participants to combine historical usage patterns with weather data to forecast bike rental demand in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.

## Dataset
The dataset for this competition can be found on the Kaggle competition page.
